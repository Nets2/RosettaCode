100 doors

There are 100 doors in a row that are all initially closed.
You make 100 passes by the doors.
The first time through, visit every door and  toggle  the door  (if the door is closed,  open it;   if it is open,  close it).
The second time, only visit every 2nd door   (door #2, #4, #6, ...),   and toggle it.
The third time, visit every 3rd door   (door #3, #6, #9, ...), etc,   
until you only visit the 100th door.

Task
Answer the question:   what state are the doors in after the last pass?   Which are open, which are closed?

after completed the question as a dumb way I found that all door are closed except door corresponding to nÂ²
so I've designed a optimized version and launched them by a main method to see the performance of each method

I obtained this return
dumb :
Operation launched 1000 times to do performance study
Operation completed in: 1 (us)
Operation completed in: 1694 (ns)
optimize:
Operation launched 1000 times to do performance study
Operation completed in: 0 (us)
Operation completed in: 57 (ns)

note:
run by VSCode WSL 
use dotnet run to get only performance displayed
use dotnet run debug to get doors statut + performance displayed
doors statut isn't counting in performance
